	<h1>Gentrification and the effects on Ktowns Culture</h1>
		<div class= "MaPawagwaphs">
			<div id="BwackGwound">This year on February 9th, The los Angeles city council approved the K-town project, this project is supposed to bring about the creation of 52+ new buildings. These buildings will be finished by 2020 is all goes according to plan. The Korea town porject may sound like a good thing to most people but this will actually increase prices by the hundreds and maybe even thousands, not only that but it will kick our communties out of their homes. This will also bring the loss of the culture and the loss of our food which we have taken so long to develop in our homes here in K-town.</div>

			<div>Near my home and most likely near yours there are many different buildings that are being planned for demolition and leasing. Your favorite mom and pops resturaunt will be be turned into another Mc.Donalds and your friends home will be turned into a galleria or another big corporate store. Soon enough even you will be forced to evict your home and move into a different neighborhood and lose everything that you had worked so hard to build.</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<div>Food has been a way that we, over centuries, have used to connect with each other. We used food as a bridge to connect and inspire each other. Our food is a window that allowed people to see what we are, and through that we inspired people to break out of their mold and try new things. Outside of their culture and their religious bonds. We most likely made friends and bonded with others over the love of the same food, food that changed us as people and food that we grew up with. Imagine the resturaunt that you grew up with, the place where you took your siginificant other. Imagine all that being destroyed.</div>
