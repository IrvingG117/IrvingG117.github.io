            <p> Throughout the years, food in Korea Town has flourished and adapted from other types of food due to its diverse population
                which has brought about the creation of fusion foods.These include, Korean-Colombian, Korean-Mexican, Korean
                American, and other types of fusions, all derived from Korean food and a different type of food. Food has grown
                not only to satisfy our culinary needs, but also the need to bring people and families to a place where they
                can relax and be with one another.

                Food culture has also allowed people to bond with one another over food. Food Culture plays a big role in out current society
                due to the fact that social media has been a place where people can share their creations and differen types
                of fusion food. It highlights places such as KoreaTown because of its diversity in food.
